I am a driven Full-Stack, DevOps, and AI engineer with a passion for designing and developing advanced server architectures. I have actively contributed to the research and implementation of Large Language Models (LLMs), collaborating on team projects and assisting LaplaceAI-Lab in AI agent server development. My experience includes designing scalable server infrastructures, maintaining robust systems that integrate both software and hardware solutions, and optimizing development workflows through CI/CD pipelines and containerized environments. I thrive on tackling complex challenges in server development, AI integration, and DevOps automation.
